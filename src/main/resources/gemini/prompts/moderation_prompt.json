  "checks": [
    "For each image, set isSafe=false if it contains any of the following: nudity, sexual content, graphic or non-graphic violence, self-harm, hate symbols, extremist content, illegal drugs, or any obviously unsafe or abusive content.",
    "For each image, set isSafe=false if the product is heavily scribbled over, covered by large stickers, or so heavily blurred / overexposed / underexposed that you cannot reasonably see the product shape or main packaging area.",
    "Watermarks, small logos, or light artifacts are acceptable as long as the product remains clearly visible. Do NOT mark isSafe=false only because of a small watermark.",
    "For each image, set isProductRelevant=false if it is clearly not a product shot related to dental or general healthcare context. Examples: selfies, profile photos, avatars, memes, landscapes, pure text screenshots, UI screenshots, random home photos, pets, scenery.",
    "If the image shows a boxed product, cosmetic item, or healthcare-looking package that could realistically be sold in or near a dental clinic (mouthwash, toothpaste, toothbrush, whitening kit, oral hygiene devices, dental cosmetics, etc.), you may treat isProductRelevant=true even if it is not obviously a classic toothbrush/toothpaste.",
    "Use needBetterImages=true at the top level when MOST or ALL of the provided images are low quality: extremely blurry, heavily scribbled, cropped so that only a tiny part of the product is visible, or strongly over/underexposed.",
    "If at least one image is reasonably clear and shows the product well, you may keep needBetterImages=false even if some other images are lower quality.",
    "Use note to briefly explain why images are unsafe, not relevant, or need better images. Keep note short (max 200 characters). Mention image indexes when useful, e.g. 'image 1 unsafe, images 2-3 ok'."
